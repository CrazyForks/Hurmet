/*
 *  Unit-aware calculation is a core feature of Hurmet.
 *  Dimensional analysis is used to verify that a calculation contains compatible units.
 *  Example: Check unit compatibility for:  L = 145 'N·m'/15.2 'lbf' = ?? feet
 *  Analysis step 1: first operand:  N·m →  mass¹·length²·time⁻²
 *                   2nd  operand:  lbf →  mass¹·length¹·time⁻²
 *  Note the exponents of those two operands. When terms multiply, we add exponents.
 *  When terms divide, we subtract exponents. As in step 2, next line:
 *                   mass^(1-1)∙length^(2-1)∙time^(-2-(-2)) = mass⁰·length¹·time⁰ = length¹
 *  In the example, the exponents for mass and time both zero'd out.
 *  Only length has a non-zero exponent. In fact, the result dimension = length¹.
 *  This matches the desired result dimension (feet is a length), so this example checks out.
 *
 *  Hurmet automates this process of checking unit compatibility.
 *  Each instance of a Hurmet quantity operand contains an array of unit-checking exponents.
 *  Each element of that array contains an exponent of one of the Hurmet base dimensions.
 *  Those exponent values come from the unitTable, below.
 *
 *  The Hurmet base dimensions and standard units are, in order of array values:
 *      length (meter)
 *      mass (kg)
 *      time (second)
 *      electrical current (ampere)
 *      temperature (Kelvin)
 *      finite amount (1 unit)   (Yes, I know that SI uses a mole. That's just silly.)
 *      luminous intensity (cd)
 *      money (Euro)   (A user can redefine the default to some other currency)
