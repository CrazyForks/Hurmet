_Hurmet_ is a web-based rich text editor endowed with live calculations. With it, you can create documents that do calculations and preserve an easy-to-read record of your work.

The emphasis is on readability. Hurmet calculations are much easier to review than spreadsheet calculations because Hurmet typically exposes all mathematical expressions and displays an echo of each expression containing the plugged-in values for each variable.

The main Hurmet page is at [Hurmet.org][1]. There is more information in the [examples page][2] and in the [documentation][3].

Hurmet can also be run locally. It is a progressive web app, so it stores a copy of itself on your local drive. If you are offline, you can still open a browser, navigate to hurmet.org, and it will be there. So will the main documentation page. (Or, you can run it on Node.js. Download the repository, cd to `Hurmet/site` and run `node server.cjs`.)

This repository contains the code used to create Hurmet.org. You are free to use this code or Hurmet.org under terms of the [MIT license][4].

If enough interest develops in Hurmet, Iâ€™ll create a forum, but for now, comments can be sent to me at ronkok55 { at } outlook.com. Bugs should be reported in the Issues page of this repository.
