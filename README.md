*Hurmet* is a web-based rich text editor endowed with live calculations. With it, you can create documents that do calculations and preserve an easy-to-read record of your work.

The emphasis is on readability. Hurmet calculations are much easier to review than spreadsheet calculations because Hurmet typically exposes all mathematical expressions and displays an echo of each expression containing the plugged-in values for each variable.

The main Hurmet page is at [Hurmet.io](https://hurmet.io/ "Hurmet.io"). There is more information in the [examples page](https://Hurmet.io/examples.html "Examples") and in the [documentation](https://Hurmet.io/docs/en/manual.html "documentation").

This repository contains the code used to create Hurmet.io. You are free to use this code or Hurmet.io under terms of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT/ "MIT license").

If enough interest develops in Hurmet, Iâ€™ll create a forum, but for now, comments can be sent to me at ronkok14 { at} outlook.com. Bugs should be reported in the Issues page of this repository.
