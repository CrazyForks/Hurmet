## Computing Pi

Archimedes (¢` ~ `250 BC)![π via Polygons][]

::: indented
Estimates ¢`π` using the perimeters of regular polygons inscribed in and
circumscribed about a circle of diameter 1. In the function below, each
iteration doubles the number of polygon sides.
:::

¢` function polygon(n)
    # start with a hexagon
    a = 2 √3
    b = 3
    for i in 1:n
      a = (2 a b) / (a + b)
      b = √(a b)
    end
    return (a + b) / 2
end `

::: indented
¢` polygon(4) = ? `, good to 4 significant digits for a 96-sided polygon
:::

Viete (1597)

::: indented
¢` 2/π = √2/2 · (√(2+ √2))/2 · √(2 + √(2+ √2))/2 \cdots `
:::

¢` function viete(numTerms)
   product = 1
   radicand = 0
   for i in 1:numTerms
      radicand = √(2.0 + radicand)
      product = product × (radicand / 2)
   end
   return 2 / product
end `

::: indented
¢` viete(10) = ? `, good to 6 significant digits after 10 terms.
:::

Leibnitz (1673)

::: indented
¢` π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ⋯ = 4 ∑_(n=0)^∞ (-1)^n/(1 + 2 n) `

¢` π_approx = 4 ∑_(n=0)^24 (-1)^n/(1 + 2 n) = ? `

Well, that converges slowly. Only 2 significant digits after 25 terms.
:::

Ramanujan (1914)

::: indented
¢` 1/π = (2√2) /9801\sum_(n=0)^∞ ((4n)! (1103 + 26390 n)) / ((n!)⁴ 396^(4n)) `

¢` format = "f30" `

First, let’s calculate ¢` √2 ` to high precision: ¢` sqrtTwo = sqRt(2, 1e-50) = ? `

¢` π_approx = 9801 / (2·sqrtTwo × ∑_(n=0)^2 ((4n)! (1103 + 26390 n)) / ((n!)⁴ 396^(4n))) = % `

That’s 24 significant digits from 3 terms. Impressive.
:::

Chudonovsky (1987)

::: indented
¢` 1/π = 12 ∑_(n=0)^∞ ((-1)^n (6n)! (13591409 + 545140134 n)) / ((3n)! (n!)³
(640320³)^(n + 1∕2) ) `

¢` sqrtBigNum = sqRt(640320^3, 1e-100) = ? `

¢` format = "f43" `

¢` π_approx = 1 / (12 ∑_(n=0)^2 ((-1)^n (6n)! (13591409 + 545140134 n)) / ((3n)!
(n!)³ (640320³)^n · sqrtBigNum)) = % `

42 significant digits from the first 3 terms. Each term adds at least 14 digits.
:::

--------------------

Two of these methods needed high-precision square roots. We got them from a
function for [Square Roots via Newton’s Method][2].

¢` function sqRt(a; ε = 1e-15)
    x = √a  # ~15 significant digits
    while true
        if |x² - a| ≤ ε return x
        x = (x + a / x) / 2
    end
end `
